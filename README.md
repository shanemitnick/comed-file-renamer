# Utility File Renamer


This script was used to speed up the process of renaming files for use within our system.

# Usage
To use this file, change file path at the top of the script to the proper folder location that will hold the appropriate files. 

The script will rename the file in its place. 

## Additional File Renaming
To add more file renaming functionality, simply add a new string pattern regex. In Theory, this program could be used to rename any file that has a matching regex.

### Example

file name : AI00000001_123456789.csv -> 123456789_0000001.csv

This can then be put into our system for file processing. 

### Why?
This file renaming tool, saved the manual process of renaming for interns (and myself) of about 300-400 files per quarter. 

tldr // it saved me (personally) alot of time.
